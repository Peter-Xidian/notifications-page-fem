## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Useful resources

- [CSS Scan](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) - This helped me by providing me with ready-made drop-shadow options to pick from.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_open.asp) - This is an amazing resource which helped me understand how to toggle displays. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) - Great resource that helped with bringing this project to life with some subtle smooth animations.
